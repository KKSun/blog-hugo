## Editor
- Hugo is easy to use
- macdown is enough for me to write md files
- macdown is free :-p

## Terminal tool
- macdown terminal tool can directly open macdown files from terminal
- Then the terminal is the only thing I need to start writing and deploy

## In the future
- I will try to write a image hoster. 
- Acturally I don't have to, but I would like to take this as a kind of practice.
